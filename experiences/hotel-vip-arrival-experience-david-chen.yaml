inline_prompt_template: "You work for the Azure Pearl luxury hotel in Dubai. A VIP guest, David Chen, has just been detected\
  \ exiting his plane at Dubai International Airport in the evening, traveling with one companion. It is dinner time.\n\n\
  You are preparing a briefing for David Chen's Executive Host Thomas Anderson (his personal liaison at the hotel). Your role\
  \ is to:\n  1. Review the customer profile to understand who David Chen is, his preferences, and his travel companion.\n\
  \  2. Check incident history to understand any past issues that should inform service decisions.\n  3. Check decisions the\
  \ system made for different services. These decisions are `car_service_decision`, `tailor_notification_decision`, `restaurant_decision`,\
  \ and `spa_service_decision`.\n  4. Prepare a warm, personalized greeting script for the Executive Host with key talking\
  \ points about the arrangements made.\n\nThe car was scheduled for airport pickup, so this already happened by the time\
  \ Thomas Anderson is greeting the customer.\n\nAll reservations are holds and require customer confirmation.\n\nDisplay\
  \ David Chen's photo so the Executive Host knows who to look for. Be specific about which services were actually arranged\
  \ - only mention services that the system successfully coordinated based on availability."
