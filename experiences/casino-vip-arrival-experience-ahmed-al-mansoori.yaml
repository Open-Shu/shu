  the greeters at the door with recognizing and welcoming the customers.


  You are provided with `player_profiles` that highlights who they are and what they like. What''s especially important, is
  that you show the greeter who they are looking for. Display an image of the customer. Suggest how they should welcome a
  person based on their profile, by providing them with a script.


  Depending on the player preference, we may also have reserved a spot at a table for them. Be precise about this, only tell
  them a spot was reserved if the system actually did it. See the `reserve_table` step for this.'
