"""Tenant-side entitlement contract.

Mirrors `shu-control-plane/src/control_plane/billing/entitlements.py:EntitlementSet`.
Kept duplicated rather than shared via a package because CP and tenant ship
independently; a shared dependency would couple their release cadence.
Keeping the shapes in lock-step is a code-review checklist item — when one
side adds a key, the other must follow before the next billing-state poll
is consumed.

Types only. Enforcement helpers (`assert_entitlement`, `require_entitlement`)
live in `enforcement.py` to avoid a circular import: `cp_client.py` imports
`EntitlementSet` from here, and anything importing the cache transitively
goes through `cp_client.py` — so this module must stay leaf-level.
